# The Core Blockchain: Unlocking Bitcoin DeFi
---

Core is the first Bitcoin-aligned EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, designed to be Bitcoin's complementary and hyper-scalable smart contract platform. With **~55% of Bitcoin mining hash** already contributing to its security model and **~$300 million worth of Bitcoin staked** through Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking, Core is unlocking Bitcoin as the prime protector and central asset of DeFi’s future.

What else does Core unlock?
* **The Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate:** Holders can earn risk-free yield with their Bitcoin through Core’s non-custodial Bitcoin staking feature.

* **Dual-Staking:** Stakers of both CORE and Bitcoin can access higher Bitcoin Risk-Free Rates.

* **End-to-End BTCfi:** Users can use engage in Bitcoin DeFi on Core’s EVM-compatible DeFi dapps.

* **Bitcoin-powered Smart Contracts:** Users can use smart contracts secured by Bitcoin’s miners and holders.

* **Turing Completeness:** Builders can bring their imagination to life on interoperable and versatile blockchain rails.

* **A Second Block Reward:** Bitcoin Miners are strengthened with extra rewards by costlessly contributing to Core’s security.

Core's major innovation is its novel consensus mechanism, Satoshi Plus, which is a combination of Delegated Proof of Work, Delegated Proof of Stake, and Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking. Delegated Proof of Work allows Bitcoin miners to costlessly expand their security to Core while earning a second block reward in the form of CORE rewards. Delegated Proof of Stake enables CORE holders to participate in Core’s security in exchange for earning CORE rewards. Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking unlocks the Bitcoin Risk-Free Rate for Bitcoin holders who stake their Bitcoin with Core, earning CORE rewards without ever giving up custody of their coins. The combination of Bitcoin miners, CORE stakers, and Bitcoin stakers secures Core’s Turing-complete, EVM-compatible smart contracts. The resulting BTCfi (Bitcoin DeFi) ecosystem marks the early stages of Bitcoin’s transition from merely a Store of Value to a true Medium of Exchange on Bitcoin-secured blockchain rails.

## Core Features

Key features of Core's offering include:

* **BTCfi Dapps:** Core is home to 100+ dapps designed to unlock the Bitcoin asset on scalable, Bitcoin-secured blockchain rails. 

* **coreBTC:** The enshrined Core-native bridged BTC.

* **stCORE:** Core offers Liquid Staking in the form of stCORE which is designed to enhance the utility of the CORE token and simplify the staking process. This initiative allows token holders to maximize their asset potential with greater flexibility and efficiency.

* **HTLC Atomic Swaps _(Coming Soon)_:** Hashed TimeLock Contracts (HTLCs) enable the trustless, peer-to-peer exchange of tokens between Core and other blockchains, including (and especially) Bitcoin.

## Problems Addressed by Core

Core addresses several key problems and issues in the blockchain space through its unique approach and technology. Here's a summary of the issues that Core is designed to overcome:

* **Bitcoin Network Scalability:** The Bitcoin network is purposefully limited in order to maximally defend its hard supply cap of 21 million. This is a good thing. Core does not alter the base Bitcoin layer, but rather expands Bitcoin’s incentive-alignment to secure its more scalable blockchain smart contracts.

* **Bitcoin Asset Scalability:** The Bitcoin asset has thus far been limited to simple activities on the base Bitcoin blockchain. By expanding the Bitcoin network’s protection to EVM-compatible smart contracts, Core enables the Bitcoin asset to be used in a much more sophisticated DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, Core is designed to enable faster and more affordable transactions for Bitcoin holders.

* **Native Bitcoin Yield:** Since Bitcoin is a purely Proof of Work blockchain, the Bitcoin asset has not had access to internal yield. Core’s Non-Custodial Bitcoin Staking mechanism brings native yield to Bitcoin for the first time in history. Holders never lose custody of their Bitcoin, yet receive the benefit of Proof of Stake rewards.

* **Bitcoin-Alignment:** Economic alignment between the Bitcoin and CORE assets is vital for the long-term sustainability of Bitcoin and Core’s symbiotic relationship. Dual Staking ties the Bitcoin and CORE assets together in perpetuity by granting higher Bitcoin staking rates to stakers of both Bitcoin and CORE tokens.

* **Long-Term Incentive Alignment:** Core is a long-term project with many ecosystem stakeholders. The interests of Bitcoin miners, Bitcoin holders, Core users, and other stakeholders are harmoniously balanced via Satoshi Plus and CORE’s tokenomics. With a total supply of 2.1 billion tokens, CORE tokens have an 81-year emissions schedule designed to uphold long-term cooperation.

* **The Blockchain Trilemma:** The Blockchain Trilemma refers to the challenges in achieving all of decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously. Core’s solution involves leaning on Bitcoin for decentralized security while also enabling EVM-compatible smart contracts and efficient block space.

* **Diminishing Bitcoin Block Rewards:** Every four years, Bitcoin miners’ block rewards are cut in half, posing a threat to long-term security incentives. Core offsets Bitcoin’s declining block rewards by offering miners a costless way to earn a second block reward by participating in Satoshi Plus consensus. Earning CORE tokens and staking those CORE tokens further incentivizes both mining Bitcoin and securing Core.
